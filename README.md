# DrainMonitoring

Drainage systems present in a territory play a vital role in the health and hygiene of both the surrounding environment and people present in the area. Overflow of drain water and leakage of sewer gases can disrupt the regular functioning of the surrounding areas and cause health issues to workers. Solving such an issue requires regular monitoring of drain or manhole systems to track changes in the level of water monitor the ambient temperature and humidity and detect the presence of toxic gases. The changes can be reported to the authorities who can take the necessary actions. In this paper, we have proposed an IoT based technology to create a system that will monitor, track, and report the above-mentioned parameters using various sensors. The data will be collected and displayed in a cloud platform and alerts are sent based on threshold values.
